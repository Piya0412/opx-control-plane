Release: Production-Grade Core Complete

This milestone represents the completion of the OPX Control Plane's
production-ready core functionality. The system is enterprise-grade
and ready for deployment in advisory workloads.

## What's Complete

### Core System (Phases 1-6)
- Deterministic incident control plane with event sourcing
- 6 Bedrock Agents with action groups
- LangGraph stateful orchestration with checkpointing
- Agent-to-agent reasoning with consensus
- Complete audit trail and replay capability

### Knowledge Layer (Phase 7.1-7.4)
- Bedrock Knowledge Base with 5 documents indexed
- RAG with citations and explainability
- OpenSearch Serverless vector search
- Read-only access with graceful degradation

### Observability Layer (Phase 8.1-8.4)
- LLM tracing with PII redaction (8.1)
- Bedrock guardrails with PII blocking (8.2)
- 3-layer output validation with bounded retries (8.3)
- Token usage analytics with cost tracking (8.4)

## Infrastructure

- 7 DynamoDB tables
- 6 Bedrock Agents
- 9 Action Group Lambdas
- 1 LangGraph Executor Lambda
- 1 Bedrock Knowledge Base
- 1 OpenSearch Serverless collection
- 2 CloudWatch dashboards
- 8 CloudWatch alarms

## Testing

- 200+ tests passing
- 12/12 validation gates passed
- Replay determinism verified
- Integration tests complete

## Documentation

- Repository restructured (60+ phase docs moved to docs/phases/)
- PLAN.md updated to reflect actual progress
- Architecture documentation rewritten
- Production readiness review completed

## What's Intentionally Deferred

- Phase 7.5: Knowledge Base Monitoring (design approved)
- Phase 8.5: Hallucination Detection (requires production data)
- Phase 8.6: Trust Scoring (depends on 8.5)
- Phase 9: Autonomous Execution (requires proven trust)
- Phase 10: Advanced Forecasting (observability must mature)

## Production Readiness

Status: ✅ PRODUCTION-READY (for advisory workloads)

- No blocking issues
- Meets enterprise standards
- Comprehensive observability
- Strong safety and governance
- Complete documentation

## Cost

- Fixed: ~$380/month
- Variable: ~$0.01-0.05 per incident
- Estimated total (100 incidents/day): ~$500-600/month

## Breaking Changes

None - this is the first production release.

## Migration Notes

N/A - first production release.
