fix(demo): correct DynamoDB query commands for incident events table

The opx-incident-events table uses 'incidentId' as partition key, not 'pk'.
This was causing query validation errors when users tried to inspect
incident events after running the demo.

Changes:
- scripts/demo_incident.py: Added schema docs and correct query for incident events
- docs/deployment/QUERY_REFERENCE.md: NEW comprehensive query reference for all tables
- docs/demo/DEMO_WALKTHROUGH.md: Fixed all query examples with correct key formats
- QUERY_FIX_COMPLETE.md: Detailed documentation of the fix
- SESSION_COMPLETE.md: Session summary

Key fixes:
- opx-incidents uses pk/sk pattern (INCIDENT#{id}, v1)
- opx-incident-events uses incidentId/eventSeq pattern
- opx-langgraph-checkpoints uses session_id/checkpoint_id pattern

This resolves the "Query condition missed key schema element" error
and provides comprehensive documentation to prevent future confusion.
